      Week one in the books, well almost, but not really.... Wow, long week, Didn't know what to expect but it wasn't that..
      First I want to say that I'm surrounded with some extremely talented folks and I can not wait to take this journey with them, and learn what ever I can.<br><br>
      Watching Shereef's video made me realize that it is ok to have some of thoughts, that keep creeping into my mind like that bad song that you can't get out of your head. The notion that I was selected is some kind of a mistake is ridiculous, I know, but that thought still enters my mind. It made me realize that maybe I am not the only one that went down that rabbit hole, all by myself, not to see daylight for 3 hours, "Make changes, flip to bowers hit update, nope didn't work, flip back make changes, command shift, update, nope that didn't work either....(3 hours later)" only to realize that I wasn't saving the document after I made the changes, that is why my changes never seemed to work. (yes that really happened) LMAO.....Time box... what a concept.. that I need to figure out in a hurry....For me, I need to relax, I'm not going to learn everything in one night, or a day. Be patient with my self, I need to give myself a chance to learn.<br><br>
      My impression of DBC has only been solidified. I see myself engaging in the culture 100%, might not be easy at times, but I will be a much better person after. I am really excited about the opportunities that DBC is offering. I hope to take the opportunities and run. With all that, I am nervous, and worried, about what the future holds!
