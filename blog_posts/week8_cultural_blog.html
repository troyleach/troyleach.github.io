          <hr class="line">

              <h3><i>Conflicts</i></h3>
            <p>
                I am one that avoids conflict. I hate it, it is stressful for me and it wears me down. There is conflict in everyday life. Sometimes we don't have to deal with it face to face with people, like the person that took that parking space you have been waiting for. The person that cuts you off on the road. It surrounds us.
            </p>

<br>
            <p>
                <b>My last experience with conflict</b><br>
                In a past life I was a general contractor. I built homes. I worked for a national home builder in Colorado. At anyone given time I would have 20 to 25 homes getting built at the same time and all were at varies stages in the construction process and my job was to manage the entire processes. With theses home were home owners. In my job I dealt with conflict everyday. It is just part of the job. There are several sub-contractors that are all working together to get this home built. They all blame everyone else for why something didn't get done, or why they need more money because they had to fix something that some other sub-contractor messed up. Everyday someone was yelling at someone else. But the home owners... can be brutal. They are spending a lot of money, some of these folks had never bought a home and to then buy home that needed to get built. They don't understand the processes. I find that most of the time the conflict starts with a miss understanding.
            </p>

<br>
            <p>
              I got a call from my boss one day asking what was wrong with.. we will call her Pat and why is she calling him telling him that the construction team that is building her house "SUCKS" and she wants us all fired. I had no idea what was going on, I hadn't even met Pat as of yet. her house was set to close on July 15th. I told him I had no idea and that I would get to the bottom of it. I immediately set up a meeting with the home owners, my sales staff, and there boss. I dreaded this meeting because I had heard from others that Pat was a pistol and she was just down right mean! This lady came into the office guns a blazing, yelling, cussing me out, remember I said that I had never met this person but she felt she could call me an <b><i>asshole</i></b>? She told me that every time she came to the house it was dirty, that she had been asking for some outlet to be moved for months and a few other small things. Then she started to cry and proceeded to tell me that we were moving the closing to her house into August and she had to be out of her place by the end of July and she had no where to go.
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
              I just stood there and let her go on for at least 10 minutes, seemed like an hour. I wouldn't let anyone else talk, just let her vent, get everything off her chest. When the dust settled I made sure that she was finished and she said anything that she needed to. So the bottom line to her rant was that someone had told her that we were moving the closing of her house from July to August. I had found out about the outlet and made sure that it was moved and the drywall was patched before our meeting so that I could at least show her that we cared about what she was upset over. Second I made it clear to her that it was NOT acceptable to cuss at us and that I understood her frustrations and I would probably have the same frustrations in her position but that didn't give her the right to cuss at me or my team. That was hard for me because I was brought up that the customer is always right even if they are not right. It is important to me that people like me. But with that being said call me a asshole or telling me that my sales team is worthless is not acceptable. 
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
              I think the fact that I just let her vent, get it off her chest, making sure she knew that I would be upset as well and that I was compassionate about her feelings defused the situation, I also think the fact I didn't argue back with her made things better as well. It also didn't hurt that I was able to tell her that we were not moving the closing date. The meeting ended on a good note. She closed on her house and all was good in the world of Pat. She even bought me a nice bottle of wine!
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
              I wouldn't change anything about what I did to be honest. We never know what is going on in peoples lives. The guy that cuts us off on the highway and then flips you off... Maybe he is rushing to get somewhere, maybe his dog just died, my point is we don't know what is going on in peoples lives that might have contributed to the conflict at hand. Find out why there is conflict, don't guess.
