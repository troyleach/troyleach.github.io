    <h2>My Thinking style and Learning</h2>
    <h5 class="date">August 2, 2014 </h5>
    <hr class="top_line">
    <p>
      I feel I should start off with some history, if your not interested by all means skip to the next paragraph! As soon as we got our DBC prep objectives I dove right into the growth and fixed mindset, the VARK questionnaire, and Gregorc thinking styles. I wont lie, it interested me. I sure did learn a lot about myself, and some of it I didn't like to be really honest. I started to do a lot research. First, my thinking style, <a href="http://www.cgribben.com/psych/ar.html"><i><mark class="color">Abstract Random</i></mark>.</a> I sent this link to friends and family. Maybe I sent it because I thought people would disagree. They didn't, in fact some even laughed, yeah thats completely me! On to fixed mind-set vs growth mind-set. I have been a very successful professional, with not much formal education. One would think that I would have a growth mind-set, Yeah, I have a fixed mind-set, now with that being said, I do have growth mind-set traits but I'm more fixed than not.
    </p>

    <p>
      So what does this mean? Well I have some work to do, on myself, about time I spend a little time on myself! How can I channel my thinking style to my advantage at DBC? I have 78 other people that I can lean on, and learn from. That's like having 78 different text books all on the same topic. (I need several different avenues to learn from, Hey thats what the report said that I bought for 2 bucks... yeah I bought the report!). I look at everyones blog, everyones code (maybe that's why I'm up till 2 or 3 every night working on our challenges). I love the pairing, I get 2 or 3 different view points on the same code or challenge, I plan on pairing more. I was told that I need to be more aggressive. I will consider this, however I am one that likes to listen, I like to see how YOU do it, your thought process and I take that and make it my own. But when i think about this, maybe that is the lack of self-confidence showing? Something for me to think about.

      My experience in phase 0.... The hole thing where I need several different avenues to learn from is killing me. The fact I have to understand something 100 percent before I <b>feel</b> I can move on....isn't working. With that being said, there are some advantages to my learning style. Once I understand it, I really know it, it is easy for me to teach others, I really enjoy that! So, I need to find my happy place. I think this all ties back to time management. When I'm working on a challenge I will research and research. I have over 100 bookmarks of things that I need (ok, want) to go back and read and study. I will read one or two paragraphs then think, this really good but I have to find something else... book mark and move on. What I'm trying to say is, instead of reading something all the way through, and then start the challenge I always think there is something better out there, so before I know it, I have NOT REALLY learned anything and it's 3 hours later. I said this last week, and I feel that if i stuck to it, it might have worked. Time box, the pomodoro technique, are two things that I think can benefit me. But I have to stick to the technique and not get side tracked. Last, I need to trust myself!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I think the biggest thing that I really want to work on, now that I understand it, is growth mind-set. Like I said earlier I don't have all the traits of a fixed mind-set. But the traits I do want to work on effect my learning 100 percent. I was just reading another blog and this person was talking about how they like to experiment, that they found they learn a lot more when they experiment. I don't do that, I have to understand what I'm doing first, I would never just start typing to see what happens.. Gotta get away from that, I have to understand why I feel, or, why I do think like that. Because in the past, when nothing is on the line, when I'm just messing around, I do experiment, and it does work, and I do learn. When I am teaching something, like diving, I always tell my students "the only stupid question, is the one that wasn't asked" I need to follow my own advice. Everyone is so welling to help, I need to take advantage of this.
