      <h3>These are true feeling...</h3>
      <h2></h2>
      Stereotype Threat....I am sure that I have felt the stresses of Stereotype Threats all through life and just didn't know that is what it was, in fact, I know that I have and I will explain a little later. I think I have experienced these emotions recently.
    </P>
<br>
    <p>
      A past experience that I know that I personally experienced stereotyping, as I understand it, in it's very basic and oldest form, was at a wedding. Rachel has a good friend that worked with her at a hospital a few years back. She was African American. She was getting married and invited us to the wedding. This is an experience that I hope I will never forget. There were over a 100 people at this wedding, food was to die for, free drinks, (that in it self made it the best best wedding ever), dancing, X NFL players, that I could have talked to for hours (I'm HUGE NFL fan) and Rachel and I were the only two white folks. 
    </p> 
<br>
    <p>
      This didn't bother me, the fact we were the only white folks there, but I understand in a way that can't be explained. Nothing happened, we had a great time. There were folks that choose not to talk me. I would say hi and they would walk away. I can only assume... that it was because I was white. The thoughts that ran through my mind that night. There were situations that I felt really uncomfortable. why didn't they say hi back? Why did he look at me that way? The other thoughts that ran through my mind were, I understand how some African Americans might feel in large groups. Please understand that I am only assuming.
      <br>
      <br>
      Other times that I have felt it was as basic as a simple conversation with a group of people, mostly guys, about school. When I was younger and would 'hang out' it always seemed like the conversation would start "where did you go to school?" Oh I went to CU, or Kansas, I went to Yale. All I could say was, I went to work! Some would say that I don't have self confidence, or I don't think very highly of myself. Trust me, I have had this conversation with people and it always seems to go back to the self confidence thing.
      <br>
      <br>
      When I'm in these situations my body changes. I can feel my blood pressure go up, I have a nasty feeling in my stomach, sometimes I might start to sweat and I get supper tired and most of the time, I just shut down.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      After listen to Claude Steele I am going to disagree with that statement that it is all a lack of self-confidence!
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      Sure, I have to admit, at least for myself anyways that some of it is a confidence thing. I will buy that, but I have never asked the question, WHY? Why is it a self confidence thing? I don't think people are born with no self confidence. Wouldn't you agree that it is a learned trait? Why do I, Troy Leach, think school is important, and since I think it is important when I am in a group of people that all went to school, some.. really good schools, do I feel inadequate? Because I was always told, "Go to school or you will amount to nothing!" Shit, I say it.. to my 21 year old niece that thinks school is a waste of time. So have I ever stood back and thought about how those words made HER feel? that's easy <i>NOPE!</i>
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      Lets bring this back on topic, time-box right? How I feel this is effecting me now is, for example, my pairing sessions. I feel like I don't participate very much, or as much as I need to. I'm afraid that I will hold others back in their learning, or what ever...
      <br>
      I took this from some text was reading that Mr Steele had to say:
<br>
<br>

          <p class = "indent">
            "When you feel under threat, you know that based on an identity you have, something bad could happen. You don't know   whether in fact it will happen. You don't know precisely what could happen or when or where it could happen"<br>
            "when your in that situation, most of your cognitive resources are devoted to vigilance." Steele said this anxiety   often manifests itself in psychological and physiological ways, including distraction, increased body temperature and   increased heart rate, all of which diminish performance levels.<br>
            "if you care about what you are doing, the prospect of being judged is upsetting and distressing and disturbing," he   said. "In a situation like this, it takes cognitive resources away from a relaxed engagement with the task at hand and   that undermines your performance."
          </p>
<br>
        <p>
          I put this in my blog because I think these are my emotions sometimes when I'm pairing with folks, and maybe in everyday life. Unless it is something that I know.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
          So it is time to put an action plan into place to help myself get over these feelings. I will NOT let the stereotyping threat get in the way of my success.  LIke the wedding, nothing bad ever happens, in fact just the opposite. It's like when your afraid to do something then when you finally get the balls to do it, and realize that nothing bad happened and  you had a lot of fun doing it, it becomes something you might do often. (for me, the fear of water, now I'm a scuba diving instructor...). These people, these fellow boots are crazy smart, I need to feed off them, they will make me successful if I let them. I will help them be successful if I let myself. I need to slow things down. I need to be ok with telling folks that it takes me a little extra time. I know they will be fine with it!
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
          There is no way we can do this by ourselves. Just too much information. We can do this, together!
