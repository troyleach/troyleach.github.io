      Favorite web sites? I spend a fair amount of time 'surfing' the web, looking at all kinds of sites for all kinds of different
      reasons. So I have thought a bit and came up with the sites that I spend the most time at. <a href="http://www.nfl.com" target="_blank" title="Pro Football" />nfl.com</a>, <a href="http://www.advanceddivermagazine.com.com" target="_blank" title="Diving" />advanceddivermagazine.com<a/>, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com" target="_blank" title="News" />usatoday.com</a>.<br><br>

      I simply can't get enough of Pro Football. I love this iste becuase it is packed full of information. I suppose I go against the norm, in most things I do, I like web sites that have lots of information, lots of different things to look at. Where you have to re-focus yourself. Unfortunately typically what my eye is drawin to when I first jump on the site is teh HUGE ad that typically presents itself, at the top, takes up the entire screen. this is really annoying to me, I understand that folks need to make money and a ton of money is made with these adds but that doesn't mean I have to like it. I have bought things for this site.. just before my beloved Broncos got "BLOWN OUT" in the super bowl, I bought a super bowl cap. As a side note, I have a really nice ball cap for sale, hardly worn, great price.... I have two spots on the the site that are important to me. One is Latest News and Fantasy Football. To me the site is basic, it has pictures to capture your attention and draw you to the story. I don't think this site solves anything other than my gross obsession with pro football. (As my wife would say, man drama). This site is all about fun, nothting really serious with it, it is just a game. if there is a breaking story the site will post it at the top.I general feel relaxed and happy after a visit, even if it short, takes my mind off the real world for a few!<br><br>

      This site is cluttered, but in a good way. This is one of my favorite sites becuase of the visual effect it has on me. I love the yellow and red on black, how it pops. I like the menu bars that have sub-menu's with links. My eye is drawn to the top of the site, it isn't the most important part of the site. It makes me happy, makes me want to go traveling, makes me want to spend a lot of money on really, really importan dive gera that I don't need!!! Site navigation is extremely easy. If one would like to know what up coming events are schedule, it is one click away, if you want to check out dive distanations, one click away. Most of the site is like this pretty straight forward in my opinion. This site never really sold anything in the past, it would have links to gear that was reviewed to places to buy. But I have notice that the ADM store is under construction so maybe that is changing, hope not. Past all the bold colors and cool pictures this site offers loads of reviews and travel information.<br><br>

      I am totally a news junky, NPR, local news, local TV and paper. USAToday is by far the site I visit the most, everyday in fact. I have to start by saying I really don't like the new format however. For me, a very simple person, the site is a little cluttered. I like the different sections. My eyes are drawn to the lead story, the picture is big and the caption is typically caughty as well. Then I scroll down to the section picutes to see if there is someting I 'have to read now'. The other thing I like about this site is the different content, everytying from news, to sports, to Adam Levine married his girlfriend Behati Prinsloo, I sure I needed to know that... right??? I think the designers tried to make the site 'pretty' when it really should have stayed the same. Simple and straight forward, at times now, it is a lillte hard to navigate and find tings. Maybe it is just becuase I'm human and I don't like change. What ever the case I still visit the site daily and the site still holds my interest. Depending on what I'm reading, the site does bring fun into my life a long with some sadness. It has lots to offer with news, travel and even crosswords. I have never bought anything from site, not a lot of ad's, I like that, there are enough places to buy things on the web.<br><br>
