          <h2 class="title">Asking the right question<span class="date">October 4, 2014</span></h2>
          <hr class="line">
       <br>   
            
              <h3><i></i></h3>
            <p>
              When I read that we had to research and write about asking the right question I was afraid. I'm not sure I ever thought about if there was an art to asking questions before. Was I asking the right question to get the right answer. Was I clear? I got full.... in your face, welcome to reality... in the is very subject. When reading Chris Pines book he talks about how some can be rude out there in the programming world and not let it bother you... Sometimes, I guess, this is harder than you might think.
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
              I was really proud of what I had done. It was the first Ruby challenge that I felt I did on my own, I had to look up syntax, but I understood the logic of the challenge I knew how I wanted to approach the challenge. It took me a few hours but I finally got the program to work just how I wanted it to.... accept one part.. I researched to no end. Every night I would spend an hour looking for a way to get the code to return what I wanted. Then, I started to look for a solution, can't lie :-) Still couldn't find it. I know that us boots are told to ask for help, ask questions. So I thought I will go to stackoverflow. Great site by the way. So I spent a good two hours writing my question, making sure grammar was correct, making sure my question was clear so that I would get the answer back that I wanted. So I was ready.... I stared at the submit button.. why was I starring? I read, re-read, looked through, just hit submit.... After I hit submit, I just stared again. Did I know something was wrong? 91 seconds later <i>BING</i>
            </p>
<br>
            <P><i>"Do correct punctuation and formatting. Your question is rude to the readers"</i></P>
            <P>then</P>
            <p><i>"I don't understand the question. What do you actually want to do?"</i></p>
<br>
            <p>I even had one response, I tried to find it and post it here as well, that told me if I didn't fix the question with in 5 minutes he would take the question off AND that my question was insulting him!!</p>
<br>
            <p>
              Really?? I thought... So I wasn't going to give up.. I re-wrote the question, looked up how to format the question, I guess there is a proper way to do this as well. I did this twice. I really wanted to learn from this and do it right. I even wrote exactly what I wanted the code to return. The next day, I got a very well written response to my question. However it still wasn't what I wanted....
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
              My point is asking the <i>Right</i> question to get a helpful answer is really quit hard. I have read other blogs and some folks think asking a question over the web is easier. I'm not sure that is the case for me. When I can talk to someone in person there is immediate response, maybe a question back to clarify. I have never had issues with this kind of thing before. Maybe, and I really believe this, maybe I don't know what or how to ask.
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
              The experience on stackoverflow really intimidated me. I haven't been back since to ask questions. In fact I really haven't asked questions of any body. I know that isn't right and writing this blog has reminded me that what happened is all part of the learning experience and I should embrace it not be scared of it! There is no way I will be able to do this by myself, that is the hole part of coming to Devbootcamp, they can't teach me if they don't know what I don't know!
            </p>
<br>
            <p>
              Some are probably wondering if I got my original question answered. I did, funny thing, From a fellow boot. We were in general conversation, checking in with each other. It came up, I didn't think about it, just asked the question and he answered it. Maybe I was over thinking the question, I find myself doing that a lot lately!!!
