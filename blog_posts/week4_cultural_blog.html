    <h1>One issue facing today's Tech world</h1>
    <h5 class="date">August 31, 2014</h5>

    <h2><i>Storage</i></h2>
  <br>
    <p>
      The amount of information we are generating is going up exponentially while the cost of storing it is not going down. Forget Analytics, where do we put it all?
    </p>
   <br> 
    <p>
      Forbes.com suggests that "the capacity of hard drives isn't increasing fast enough to keep up with the explosion of digital data worldwide. Forecasts call for a 50-fold increase in global data by 2020". Thats huge. The other day I was in verizon taking care of some personal business. While I was waiting for someone to help me I over heard two separate conversations. Out buying phones, I bet 5 minutes of the conversation was on the storage capacity of the phone for music and pictures. We save everything...
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
      So, we have come up with different ways to save data. Remember the 5-1/4 floppy disk drive? Do you have any data stored on a floppy? You might be out of luck retrieving that data. Now we get into the issue of our storage devices becoming obsolete! Now we use SD cards, external hard drives, DVDs, Blu_ray discs and more are all currently in regular use - but which ones will go the way of the floppy disc, in the near future? My guess, you might ask, CD and DVD... When something like your iphone will hold bazillion gigabytes of music?? Just my opinion.
    </p>    
<br>
    <p>
      Moving data storage to the cloud is an option for individuals, but it doesn't address the overall issue of data growth and storage. Something still needs to store that data somewhere, it really isn't stored in the clouds... :-). I wont get into the other issue that comes from this problem of data storage and that is the security. All that data, that we store we also need to make sure it is safe!
    </p>
<br>
    <h3><i>My last thought</i></h3>
    <p>
      Everything is digital now. Just deleting old data isn't an option in my opinion. Who is going to determine the criteria by which data is to be judged 'not useful'? Development of new technologies is always an option and in this persons eyes the only option. What about biological storage, think about how much information is stored in your <a class="links" href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/134672-harvard-cracks-dna-storage-crams-700-terabytes-of-data-into-a-single-gram">DNA?</a>
    </p>
<br> 
    <p>Something to think about....</p>
