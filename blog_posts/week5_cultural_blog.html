    <h1>Pairing and giving feedback</h1>

    <h2><i>Pairing</i></h2>
  <br>
    <p>
      Pairing has been an interesting learning and growing tool for me. At first I wasn't sure how this all was going to work. Was I was going to like sharing ideas? Was my pairing partner going to think I'm stupid? Or think my ideas were dumb or think I was behind? Would I get a long with these folks? Would they like me? 
    </p>
   <br> 
    <p>
      I think it is a lot of fun solving challenges with others, it is nothing like what I expected. None of the above is true. Everyone of us has different opinions on how to get to the end result. I find myself learning twice as much. Sometimes it is a little overwhelming, the information that is coming in. I think the most rewarding thing for me is listening and watching somebody solve a challenge. To hear their thought processes. I have found that I am changing some of how I think about things and how I get to the end result based on things I have seen from others. The only thing I find frustrating is somethings I feel like I could be participating more. With that being said, sometimes I just flat out don't know what's going on. I really like to listen and watch others and learn from them. But, I know that isn't helping the over all goal. So all I can do is work on that and I am. I hope this next week will be better!

    <h2><i>Feedback</i></h2>
  <br>
    <p>
      I was a little scared the first time I received feedback. But ultimately it is to make me a better person! The worry I had with feedback was, how was I going to take that feedback, the 'constructive' feedback. The first piece of constructive feedback was from a instructor that reviewed one of my solo projects. That about killed me, I was in a bad mood for two days. We all want to do the best we can right? I automatically thought... I'm on thin ice now, I better do better...Those are all normal thoughts... right?? I got over it and everything this person said was true and they were all things that I need to work on. I have since gotten other constructive feed back. Some things I know I have to work on already and others that I didn't. I really have to work on being more engaged in the pairing session. I am going to try and explain that I can't, and wont, go as fast as others. Explain how I have been working through challenges and come up with a way that both my pairing partner and I can work together to help me be more engaged! I find it hard to leave feedback. One issue that I was having was I was waiting till the end of the week to leave my feedback. I stopped doing that, I couldn't remember how the session went. so I typically leave it right after the session now. The other thing that I struggle with is leaving the constructive feedback. Sometimes there just isn't anything to leave, but with that being said, there is something that everyone can work on. So I have tried really hard in the last few weeks to leave something that maybe needs a little work.

    <h3><i>My last thought</i></h3>
    <p>
     Pairing with people to solve problems has been an great experience for me. It has helped me grow as a person, even with simple social skills. People have helped me think out side of my box. I think I learn better through another person rather than books and google. (At least sometimes anyway) On the flip side, I hope that others might have gained some insight to them selfs through my feedback and I have helped somebody grow as a person. That's a great feeling to help people.
