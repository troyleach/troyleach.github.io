				<p>With the help of the Pit Barrel smoker you can cook tasty berbeque and also grill dishes. This short introduction will quide you through the process of cooking with the Pit Barrel cooker.</p>

				<p>One of the most important things to berbeques are the coals. In my opinion Kingsford is the only coal to use. Remove the basket from teh barrel and place it on solid surface of stone, not wood!</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<img class="bbq_image" src="images/bbq3.JPG" />
				<p>After the basket is on a protective surface, take the coals and fill the basket up. don't be shy fill it up. Then apply lighter fluid. Do NOT apply lighter fluid once the basket is back in the barrel, ever!</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<img class="bbq_image" src="images/bbq4.JPG" />
				<p>Place the basket back inside the barrel and light, with the lid off. Wait exactly 20 minutes at higher elevations. (VERY IMPORTANT)</p>
			</div>

				<p>After 20 minutes your coals should look like this...</p>
			</div>

			<div>

				<p>Then, hang the desired meat, or fish, or I have smoked veggies.. what ever you want!! At this point you can also had wet wood chips to get different flavors!</p>
			</div>

			<div>

				<p>The cooking time really depends on what elevation you are at and what your cooking..</p>
