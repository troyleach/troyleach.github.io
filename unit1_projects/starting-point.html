      <p>Responsive Web Design was the answer to the problem of "changing landscapes". In essence, due to the fact that the internet was now readily accessible on different mediums such as smart phones and tablets, users expected to be able to browse the web with as much ease on these new devices as they did before on their personal computers. For this reason, web developers started creating various versions for each website to accomodate the new devices. In retrospect, due to the fact that the technology industry is continously evolving it did not seem like a permanent fix to continue to create two versions of every site. Thus Responsive Design was born.</p>

      <p>The fundamental concept behind responsive design lies in the fluid gird. The standard before hand-held web browers were readily accessible, and when everyone viewed websites primary on a computer-sized screen, was that websites were created using fixed wisth layouts. The web pages would be designed using pixels as the primary unit of measure to modify changes to the appearance of the website. This process would create a standard layout which at the time was acceptable due to a lack of various screen resolutions.</p>
      <p>The idea behind creating Fluid grids is that, by using percentages as opposed to a pixel count for the new unit of measure, the website can become adaptable to the size of the screen. When used conciously, the site can be designed so that all of the elements on the page will "resize their widths in relation to one another."</p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
     <!-- Discuss the purpose of responsive design and fluid layouts and whether
      you think it's good practice to use them.
      Add html tags where necessary.-->
      <p>After learning the fundamental concepts revolving around Responsive Web Design and Fluid Layouts we feel that it is not only the best practice, but should always be 
          incorporated into any website or webapp. Because of todays technology constantly evolving it seems at though screen size is getting smaller and smaller and most people
          primarily access the internet via their hand-held devices, on the go. This seems like something any serious web developer should keep in mind while creating their sites.

      You don't need to keep these questions visible.
      <ul>
        <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
        <p>I felt that implenting this concept was simple enough. however we have a very simple site. I am sure I will need a lot more research for more complicated issues.</P>
        <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
        <p>There are a lot of different ways I think that hand-helds have changed web design. Go to a party, guys are on ESPN, ladies are looking at Facebook. somebody is in an argument so they are googling to find the answer. no body has desktop computer anymore. I heard the other day this comment "why get a labtop when I have my phone. It isn't changing, its changed! I think we are heading for big changes. with the TV tech. these days, having touch screen TV's bigger and smaller media. it's crazy to think what could happen.</p>
        <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
        <p>I really don't know how the visually impaired folks work on the net. I know they do. I would assume it is speak based.. so.. what I see happening is something a long the lines of Siri. I think it is already here. we just need to push it to the next level... hmm, I see a project!</p>
        <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li> 
        <p>This concept, responsive web design. what a great concept!! I still really don't get why anyone would design defferently other than graphics design folks and even then, I still think you can have super design layouts. I really don't think anything is stupid at this pont. I have yet had to say to myself.. god, why is it done that way....</p>
